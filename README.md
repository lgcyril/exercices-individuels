# What is my Chinese Zodiac ? : One of my first individual exercise at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank">Ada Tech School!</a>
**Autor :** Cyril<br>

**The idea :** I have developed in html and Javascript to exercise with loops and pics. Find your Chinese zodiac and get your zodiac animal sign according to your birth year/month/day and find your horoscope.<br>

**Languages    :** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript<br>
**Tools        :** Notion, Slack, Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code<br>
**Organization :** Daily review of the steps to achieve, debugging, clean code and agility<br><br>
**I am very proud of my first html and js codes after only two weeks at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank">Ada Tech School!</a>**
